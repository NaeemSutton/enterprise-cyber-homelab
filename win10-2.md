# 🪟 Win10-2 (Secondary Domain Endpoint)

This VM is a second Windows 10 machine joined to the `ecorp.local` domain. It serves as an extra endpoint for simulating lateral movement, logon activity, and endpoint visibility.

---

## 🖥️ Host Info

- **VM Name**: `Win10-2`
- **OS**: Windows 10 Pro
- **Network**: `Ecorp (10.0.1.0/24)`
- **IP Address**: 10.0.1.13 (example)
- **Domain Joined**: `ecorp.local`
- **Hostname**: `WIN10-2`
- **Logged-in User**: `ecorp\win10user2`

---

## 🛠️ Setup Summary

- ✅ Set static IP and pointed DNS to AD Controller (`10.0.1.15`)
- ✅ Renamed machine to `WIN10-2`
- ✅ Joined `ecorp.local` domain
- ✅ Logged in with domain user `win10user2`
- ✅ Verified connectivity with Domain Controller and peer hosts

---

## 🔍 Purpose

- Used to test multi-host visibility
- Useful for lateral movement simulation (e.g., PsExec, SMB)
- Helps test logon behavior from a different machine/user
- Expands attack surface for red/blue team experiments

---

## 🔐 Logging

- ❌ Splunk Forwarder not yet installed
- ❌ Sysmon not yet installed
- Used for testing endpoint activity from an “unmonitored” host

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Install Splunk Universal Forwarder (optional)
- Deploy Sysmon with same config as `Win10-1`
- Simulate domain logons, RDP, file access
- Observe event visibility gap when logging is disabled

---

## 🧠 Notes

- Use this host to test “blind spot” in detection coverage
- Consider enabling it as a pivot point for red team activity
