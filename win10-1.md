## 🛠️ Setup Summary

- ✅ Static IP set and DNS pointed to Domain Controller (10.0.1.15)
- ✅ Joined domain `ecorp.local` via System Settings
- ✅ Installed Sysmon for host telemetry
- ✅ Installed Splunk Universal Forwarder
- ✅ Confirmed connectivity to Domain Controller, pfSense, and other VMs

## 🔍 Validation Checklist

| Check                          | Status |
|-------------------------------|--------|
| Can ping Domain Controller     | ✅     |
| Can log in with domain user    | ✅     |
| Sysmon installed and running   | ✅     |
| Splunk UF forwarding events    | ✅     |

## 📌 Next Steps

- Simulate logon events, failed logins, and PowerShell usage
- Capture event artifacts and match with Splunk detections
- Optionally: Install Sysinternals or endpoint monitoring tools

---

## 🧠 Notes

- This is the main test machine for endpoint detections
- All attack simulations should be correlated with logs from this host
